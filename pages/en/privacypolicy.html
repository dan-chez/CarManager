            <h3>More information for users</h3>

            <h3>Legal basis for processing</h3>

            <p>The data controller may process the user's personal data if one of the following conditions is met:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>When users have given their consent for one or more specific purposes.</li>
                <li>When obtaining data is necessary for the fulfillment of a contract with the user and/or any other
                    pre-contractual obligation thereof.</li>
                <li>When processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation that applies to the user.</li>
                <li>When processing is related to a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of
                    official authority vested in the controller.</li>
                <li>When processing is necessary for the purpose of a legitimate interest pursued by the controller or a
                    third party.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>In any case, the data controller is available to define the specific legal bases that apply to the
                processing, particularly if obtaining personal data is a contractual or statutory requirement, or a
                requirement necessary to formalize a contract.</p>

            <h3>Further information about retention period</h3>

            <p>Unless otherwise indicated in this document, personal data will be processed and retained for the time
                necessary and for the purpose for which they were collected, and may be retained for longer periods due
                to relevant legal obligations or based on user consent.<br><br>Therefore:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>The personal data collected for the formalization of a contract between the data controller and the
                    user must be retained as such until such contract has been fully formalized.</li>
                <li>The personal data collected in the legitimate interest of the data controller must be retained for
                    the time necessary to fulfill that purpose. Users can find specific information related to the
                    legitimate interest of the data controller by consulting the relevant sections of this document or
                    by contacting the data controller.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The data controller may retain personal data for an additional period when the user consents to such
                processing, provided that such consent remains valid. Additionally, the data controller may be required
                to retain personal data for an additional period whenever necessary for compliance with a legal
                obligation or by order of the authority.</p>

            <p>Once the retention period has ended, personal data must be deleted. Therefore, the rights of access,
                erasure, rectification, and data portability cannot be exercised once this retention period has expired.
            </p>
